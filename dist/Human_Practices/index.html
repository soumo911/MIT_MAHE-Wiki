It's food o’ clock. Cooking is a lot more than just food, it brings people closer together. Throughout history, fish has been utilised by humans as a food source. Fishes are <strong>integrated</strong> into <strong>many traditions</strong> throughout the world being the traditional food for Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, or through fish festivals etc. It plays a huge role in ceremonial traditions, creating important ties between families and individuals and embodying their symbolic ties to the environment in communities residing in coastlines. Many countries have fishes as a part of their <strong>primary diet</strong>.</p><p>However, methylmercury and it's prevalence in seafood is a major deterrent. Hence, in an attempt to create awareness as well as celebrate different recipes from around the world we have curated <strong>Something’s fishy.</strong></p><p>To download this document, click <a href="../assets/docs/iGEM-MIT_MAHE-SAUL-Handbook.pdf">here</a>.</p><embed src="../assets/docs/iGEM-MIT_MAHE-SAUL-Handbook.pdf" type="application/pdf" title="iGEM-MIT_MAHE-SAUL-Handbook"><h1>Taxonomy of Hanoi</h1><p>In order to spread the beauty of biology during the COVID-19 pandemic, we decided to develop a game. The game developed follows the concept of Tower of Hanoi, one of the most popular puzzles. The aim of the game is to transfer the tower of n disks from the first rack to the third (last) one. This has to be done by ensuring that while stacking the disks, a smaller disk is always placed over a larger disk. The reverse is forbidden. Our version of the game tries to put out a fun twist to learning taxonomic ranks. The disks represent the rank. Young children can learn the taxonomic classifications for widely known creatures like humans, butterflies and lions.</p><p><a href="https://www.google.com">Download the game</a></p><h1>Newspaper Article</h1><p>In order to spread information about methylmercury poisoning: it's source, exposure, long term effects, treatment and its prevalence in fishes, we have written a newspaper article in the local language of Kannada which is to be published in a newspaper.</p><p>To download this document, click <a href="../assets/docs/Newspaper-Article.pdf">here</a>.</p><embed src="../assets/docs/Newspaper-Article.pdf" type="application/pdf" title="Newspaper-Article"><h1>Data</h1><h3>Fish Consumption</h3><p>Having a long coastline, fish is a <strong>staple food</strong> for many people in India. Some of the major fishing communities are the Kolis in Maharashtra, Mogaveeras in Karnataka, Jalaris and Rajbhansis in Orissa, Mukkuvars and Paravas in Tamil Nadu etc. The Tangkhul people of Manipur celebrate Khairi Kashao in the dry months of April or May. This festival is a means to invoke the rain gods, it is also parallelly an occasion for mass fishing. The traditional fishing festival of the Jaunpuri community of Tehri Garhwal, Maund Matsya Mela is what the festival in Uttarakhand is called. This festival was started as a means to reduce exploitative fishing all year in the river. The Chang people of Nagaland celebrate Khiliinyie, which is a week-long harvesting festival. This shows the <strong>high relevance</strong> of our project in our native country.</p><div class="row"><div class="col-md"><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/HP--High-Bar.png" alt="High Consumption" style="width: 100%"><p>Figure 1: High Consumption</p></div></div><div class="col-md"><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/HP--Mod-Bar.png" alt="Moderate Consumption" style="width: 100%"><p>Figure 2: Moderate Consumption</p></div></div></div><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/HP--Low-Bar.png" alt="Low Consumption" style="width: 80%"><p>Figure 3: Low Consumption</p></div><h3>Complex Nitrogen sources</h3><p><strong>Nitrogen</strong> is one of the primary nutrients critical for the survival of all living organisms.

They helped in innumerable ways to shape our project from a problem statement to a solution.</p><h4>Dr. Keyur Raval:</h4><p>Design of a bioreactor can make or break the effective implementation of a project. Hence, we sought advice from Dr. Keyur Raval, an associate professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Karnataka. His knowledge and expertise in <strong>scale-up of cell cultures, bioreactor design, bioprocess development and optimization</strong> enabled us to understand the considerations involved in these areas.</p><p>At first we had decided to <strong>remove the antibiotic-resistance genes</strong> from the final product considering the <strong>safety aspects</strong>. However, he said that the presence of antibiotic-resistance genes would create a <strong>plasmid conservation pressure</strong> during production which would ensure that <strong>plasmid loss would not occur</strong> as well as <strong>prevent contamination of media.</strong> Hence, we modified the final design of each plasmid to have a different antibiotic resistance gene in the final strain developed for production.</p><p>However, inclusion of such genes in the final strain design poses the threat of imparting <strong>unnecessary antibiotic resistance</strong> to the natural gut microbiome. When we voiced our concerns about this, he suggested the usage of <strong>CRISPR Cas 9 technology</strong> to integrate our design to the genome of the bacteria. However, we decided <strong>against it</strong> as the long term effects of this recent technology are not known. In addition, <strong><em>Escherichia coli</em> Nissle 1917</strong> <strong>cannot conjugate</strong> and thus <strong>cannot participate in Horizontal Gene Transfer</strong> which made us more confident about the traditional method.</p><p>Initially our media formulation used <strong>glucose and tryptone</strong> as the carbon source. However, he directed us towards the fact these components can be a source of food for <strong>humans and animals</strong> and tryptone would be too expensive on a large scale - thus increasing final product cost. Hence, we modified our media formulation as well as cryo and lyoprotectant composition to contain <strong>glycerol</strong> instead. Our nitrogen source was fixed to be only <strong>yeast extract</strong> at first, however, he asked us to consider the costs of doing so. He said that since the main cost driver of bioprocessing is incurred due to raw materials, different regions might prefer different nitrogen sources depending on <strong>cost and availability</strong>. Hence, our media formulation was changed to be variable according to availability. He also suggested the use of <strong>SCaBa impellers</strong> as they are the current industry standard.</p><p>We also presented the design of SAUL to him. He noticed that <strong>our retention time</strong> in the device was too low as compared to the retention time of food in the gut. This enabled us to <strong>improve</strong> the <strong>experimentation</strong> aspects further.</p><h4>Dr. Abdul Ajees:</h4><p>Due to the pandemic, the modelling aspects of our project became even more important. To visualize the structure of our protein and understand its aspects, we consulted <strong>Dr. Abdul Ajees</strong>, associate professor, Department of Atomic and Molecular Physics, Manipal Academy of Higher Education. He guided us about the various visualization techniques such as molecular dynamics. We wanted to see how <strong>methylmercury</strong> interacts with <strong>alkylmercury lyase</strong> and what are the conformational changes in the structure due to the interactions. He suggested the use of the <strong>Morph</strong> command on the PyMol software which enabled us to do the same and guided us on what the changes suggested about the proteins.</p><h4>Dr. Sudha Somayaji:</h4><p>As a therapeutic project, one of our most important stakeholders are doctors who would be prescribing the medicines, we interviewed Dr. Sudha Somayaji, Gynaecologist and Obstetrician practicing in Mangalore, Karnataka, India. Her concerns about <strong>large capsules</strong> being a difficult mode of delivery for children helped us to survey more and keep <strong>two variants</strong> of our product - for adults and for children.</p><h4>Dr. Vytla Ramachandra Murty:</h4><p>At the beginning stages of designing a bioreactor, we were considering several options for the type of reactor to be chosen. We explained our project and needs to Dr. Vytla Ramachandra Murty, a professor in the Department of Biotechnology, Manipal Institute of Technology who recommended <strong>stirred batch fermenters</strong> as an appropriate choice.</p><h4>Ms. Archana Mahadev Rao:</h4><p>In order to develop a product, innumerable aspects have to be considered. To ensure we have done the same, Ms. Archana Mahadev Rao, professor in department of biotechnology, Manipal Institute of technology, gave us a good manufacturing practices checklist. She said that given a product and a desired annual production rate bioprocess design <strong>endeavours to answer several questions</strong>, them being</p><ul><li>What are the required amounts of raw materials and utilities?</li><li>What is the required size of process equipment and supporting utilities?</li><li>What is the manufacturing cost?</li><li>What is the optimum batch size?</li><li>How long does a single batch take?</li><li>How much product can be generated per year?</li><li>What is the demand for resources in the course of a batch?</li><li>What is the amount of resources consumed?</li><li>Are there any bottlenecks?</li></ul><p>Following this, we were able to design <strong>several preliminary experiments</strong> (refer to iGEM MIT_MAHE Product Development Experiments Handbook) which we had not considered initially.</p><h4>Dr. Saran Kumar:</h4><p>In order to ensure that we have considered all possibilities during our design phase, we approached Dr. Saran Kumar, Postdoctoral fellow, Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel. He asked us innumerable questions of the various possibilities and ensured that we have chosen the best possible design. He expressed his concerns about the <strong>plasmid length</strong> which is also one of our concerns. Hence we designed an experiment which would measure the <strong>rate of plasmid loss</strong> due to length.</p></article></div></div></div></main><footer><div class="container"><div class="row justify-content-center"><div id="footerTeamLogo"></div></div><p>iGEM MIT_MAHE</p><p>Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal</p><p>Manipal Academy of Higher Education</p><p>Eashwar Nagar, Manipal, Udupi, Karnataka, India</p><div class="row justify-content-center" id="footerIcons"><a class="gmail" href="mailto:manipalbiomachines.igem@gmail.com"></a><a class="insta" href="https://instagram.com/manipalbiomachines" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a class="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/m_biomachines)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a class="facebook" href="https://facebook.com/manipalbiomachines" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></div></div></footer><script src="../content.bundle.js"></script></body></html>
