To ensure the same, consideration of all the precautions and safety measures must be taken to make the work environment, manufacturing environment and consumer product safe and to prevent any hazardous situations. <strong>Material safety data sheets</strong> for all reagents should be kept handy (List of reagents used have been given in the handbook).</p><h1>Bacteria</h1><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Safety--angel--coli.jpg" alt="Safe chassis bacteria" style="width: 30%"><p>Figure 1: Safe chassis bacteria</p></div><p>Our entire project requires a Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1) laboratory. This is because our project has proposed the use of Biosafety level 1 bacteria (<strong><em>Escherichia coli</em> DH5alpha</strong> and <strong><em>Escherichia coli</em> Nissle 1917</strong>) as our probiotic chassis <a href="#citation1">iGEM - safety risk groups</a> and therefore we consider our project to be harmless to researchers in this aspect. None of the designed experiments are expected to increase the pathogenicity of the bacteria.</p><p>The bacteria <em>Escherichia coli</em> Nissle 1917 is an extremely well studied probiotic strain with <strong>no known negative effects</strong> on health <a href="#citation2">Pradhan, S., &amp; Weiss, A. A., 2020</a>. It <strong>does not</strong> have the ability to become an <strong>aerosol</strong> and has <strong>no known pathogenic effects</strong> on <strong>animals</strong> and <strong>plants</strong> as well. It is responsible for producing fitness factors called ‘colicins' that are toxic to other <strong>Escherichia coli</strong> strains. In our case, it would be an advantage as we want our bacteria to compete while it stays in the gut. Furthermore, its ability to form biofilms increases its long-term persistence in the gut.</p><p>We would not reveal important information like activation mechanisms, etc to ensure that <strong>dual use</strong> does not occur (unless it has all the required clearances).</p><h1>Biosafety &amp; Biosecurity</h1><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Safety--dual--use.png" alt="Dual Use" style="width: 90%"><p>Figure 2: Dual Use</p></div><p>Team Bielefeld-CeBiTec 2015 proposed a detailed analysis of biosecurity, particularly the <strong>dual use</strong> issue, with respect to the iGEM competition in which they have mentioned several aspects and questions to be considered <a href="#citation3">Bielefeld-CeBiTec, 2015</a>. Some of the questions which we have answered are given below (More can be found in the handbook).</p><p><strong>Can you imagine any malevolent use of the knowledge and sequences published on your team's wiki? Could the knowledge you provide be used for the creation of products or organisms that pose a danger to humans or the environment?</strong></p><p>Our project involves the release of an anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) whose release is regulated by a control mechanism involving SoxS and SoxR genes. The SoxR gene is also regulated to be released only in the presence of methylmercury using the MerR-PmerT mercury responsive genes.</p><p>Selective mutation of any of these control mechanisms could lead to release of IL-10. This could lead to reduced immune response to pathogens. IL-10 also down regulates transcription and secretion of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and G-CSF by activated monocytes and macrophages. This could lead to cancer <a href="#citation4">Schreiber S, 1997</a>. IL-10 upregulates ICAM-1 within neural tissues. This promotes massive macrophage influx, demyelination due to inflammation and subsequent loss of neural tissue, resulting in muscle weakness and paralysis <a href="#citation5">Dru S., 2009</a>.</p><p><strong>Who will use your product? If your product is successful, who will receive benefits and who will be harmed?</strong></p><p>Our product if successful will be used by people who are at risk for methylmercury poisoning. We have made sure to not use any allergens or preservatives which could potentially harm consumers.</p><h3>WHO Questionnaire</h3><p><strong>WHO also has a self-assessment questionnaire</strong> to ensure that good quality, ethical research activities are conducted in safe and secure facilities.

Aseptic conditions must be maintained in order to <strong>prevent contamination</strong> by unwanted DNA or organisms. Gloves must be used not only for handling hot equipment and chemicals but also for cold samples taken out of the freezer to <strong>avoid cold burns</strong>. The stains and other hazardous substances should be handled with care during gel electrophoresis, sonication and gas chromatography.</p><p>Labs must be equipped with an <strong>emergency shower, eyewash station,</strong> and a <strong>first aid kit</strong> and workstation must be cleaned. Disposal of all waste materials must be done properly.</p><h3>SAUL</h3><p><strong>Isolation</strong> of all <strong>electronic components</strong> from any conducting media should be ensured. All wiring connections should be <strong>insulated properly</strong>, and care must be taken to <strong>avoid spilling</strong> or leakage of chemicals or fluids onto the motors.</p><p>After experiments which involve methylmercury and paraquat, the dialysis tube must be <strong>discarded</strong> and other equipment components should be thoroughly cleaned following the handling protocols. Any leakage into the incubator should be prevented by placing the entire set up in a <strong>closed air tight container</strong>. All of the components used in the design are checked for <strong>temperature</strong> and <strong>pH resistance.</strong></p><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Safety--garbage--can.jpg" alt="Specialized disposal" style="width: 40%"><p>Figure 5: Specialized disposal</p></div><h3>Product Development</h3><p>All the experiments designed are <strong>relatively safe</strong>.

The water released during drying or other process must be <strong>sterilized</strong> before discarding. The API in our case is <em>Escherichia coli</em> Nissle 1917 which is a <strong>non-pathogenic known probiotic strain</strong>. The API concentration must be at recommended levels for a probiotic. The equipment used must have minimum surface area and should be sterilized regularly with non-harmful substances. The <strong>excipients</strong> used must <strong>not contain</strong> any known <strong>allergens</strong> as well as <strong>preservatives</strong>. Contamination of the product must be prevented by repeated cleaning and <strong>sterilization</strong> of all components including <strong>air, equipment, media etc.</strong></p><h3>Powder Design</h3><p>Since the volume of the microorganisms present in bioreactors is much larger, extreme care must be taken to prevent the contamination of the bioreactor itself and also the surrounding environment.</p><p>There are possibilities of liquid spills and aerosol formation for some widely used bacterial chassis. However, the bacteria we have proposed is <em>Escherichia coli</em> Nissle 1917 which is a risk 1 <strong>non-pathogenic organism</strong> and does not have the capability to form aerosols.</p><p>The proximity of large volumes of liquid and mains electrical equipment (eg, from heaters, aerators, sensors, etc) presents a hazard. Commercially-designed equipment from a reliable source should prevent access to live conductors.</p><p>In case of any gas production, the gases must be <strong>vented out</strong> to prevent high pressure build up, and it should be kept away from fire.</p><p>The quality and safety of the manufactured product should be a key concern in order to ensure the client's safety <a href="#citation11">Prevention of microbial contamination during manufacturing- Pharmaceutical guidelines</a>.</p><h3>Plant Hygiene</h3><ul><li>Air filtration and air change rates must be set and done regularly.</li><li>In case of contamination in one area, the plant should have a HVAC system which would remove and prevent contaminants from spreading to other areas.</li><li>Ventilation dampers should also be positioned away from the production area for maintenance purposes.</li></ul><h3>Personnel Hygiene</h3><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Safety--equipment.jpg" alt="Personal Protective Equipment" style="width: 40%"><p>Figure 6: Personal Protective Equipment</p></div><ul><li>The personnel handling the production must be <strong>trained on the importance of hygiene</strong> and it should be ensured that they would wear protective clothing such as <strong>hair cover, overshoes, over garments, beard covers,</strong> etc. to prevent any sort of contamination.</li><li>It is required to ensure that direct contact with the product or an equipment which comes in contact with the product is avoided.</li></ul><h3>Cleaning</h3><ul><li>Cleaning agents must be of a <strong>suitable grade</strong> to minimize any health risks.

Any harm to the manufacturers due to dust particles or micro-organisms should be avoided by providing <strong>quality equipment, adequate hygiene training</strong> and <strong>regular cleaning and sterilization.</strong> The capsule integrity and sterility must be ensured during filling. <strong>Quality control of capsules</strong> should be done at each key stage. Different processes must be performed at different sections of the plant to prevent contamination.</p><p>There are <strong>four different levels</strong> at which a sterile pharmaceutical company should grade its control production: A B C and D. Grade A should be the zone for <strong>high risk operations</strong> like filling zone and zone for making aseptic connections; this zone should have laminar airflow systems with homogeneous airspeeds. Grade B is the <strong>background environment</strong> for grade A that allows for aseptic preparation and filling. Grade C and D are <strong>classified areas</strong> that handle the less critical stages of SPM <a href="#citation12">Controlled areas in sterile manufacturing - pharmaceutical guidelines</a>.</p><h3>Packaging</h3><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Safety--packaging.png" alt="Packaging" style="width: 90%"><p>Figure 7: Packaging</p></div><p>Blister punching machine is closed at the manufacturing part, thus remaining <strong>tamper resistant</strong>.

Before processing, <strong>any unnecessary waste generation</strong> must be checked and adequate measures should be taken.</p><h4>Reuse</h4><p>Re-use means the use of a product on more than one occasion, either for the same purpose or for a different purpose, without the need for reprocessing. Re-use avoids discarding a material to a waste stream when its initial use has concluded. The integrity of the product or equipment must not be sacrificed.</p><h4>Recycling</h4><p>Recycling involves the treatment or reprocessing of a discarded waste material to make it suitable for subsequent reuse either for its original form or for other purposes. <strong>Unused or haphazardly filled capsules</strong> should be <strong>recycled</strong> keeping in mind sterility. Discard water must be sterilized and used for some other purposes.</p><h1>Handbook</h1><p>Please refer to the full safety handbook for all details.</p><p>The Safety Handbook includes detailed and complete safety considerations of every reagent, process, experiment, device, equipment, etc described in the other handbooks as well as biosecurity and biosafety issues of our project.</p><p>To download this document, click <a href="../assets/docs/iGEM-MIT_MAHE-Safety-Handbook.pdf">here</a>.</p><embed src="../assets/docs/iGEM-MIT_MAHE-Safety-Handbook.pdf" type="application/pdf" title="iGEM-MIT_MAHE-Safety-Handbook"></article><article id="references"><h1>References</h1><ol><li id="citation1"><p class="author"></p><cite>iGEM safety risk groups. iGEM safety risk groups.</cite><p><span class="details">(2020).
