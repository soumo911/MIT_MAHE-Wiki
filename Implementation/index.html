Initially, in order to ensure safety, we had proposed a design where the antibiotic resistance gene was removed from the bacteria so that any unnecessary resistances would not be imparted to the natural gut biota.</p><p>However, <strong>Dr. Keyur Raval</strong> said that the presence of antibiotic-resistance genes would create a plasmid conservation pressure during production which would ensure that plasmid loss would not occur as well as prevent contamination of media. Hence, each plasmid will have a different antibiotic resistance gene in the final strain developed for production. The final recombinant bacteria must be preserved using cryopreservation techniques.</p><p>However, inclusion of such genes in the final strain design poses the threat of imparting unnecessary antibiotic resistance to the natural gut microbiome. When we voiced our concerns about this, he suggested the usage of CRISPR-Cas-9 technology to integrate our design to the genome of the bacteria. However, we decided against it as the long term effects of this technology is not known. In addition, <em>Escherichia coli</em> Nissle 1917 does not have the ability to undergo conjugation and thus cannot participate in Horizontal Gene Transfer which made us more confident about the traditional method.</p><p>Furthermore, he provided guidance on how we should formulate a <strong>metabolic stoichiometric equation</strong> as well as <strong>design bioreactors</strong> based on need and availability as opposed to keeping a restrictive approach. He helped us identify the different aspects that need to be looked into like media formulation, biomass equations, bioreactor design, etc. Initially, we considered only yeast extract as our proposed nitrogen source.</p><blockquote><p>The largest cost driver in any bioprocess are raw material costs. The cost and availability of nitrogen sources depends on the industries present in that area</p><p><strong>Dr. Keyur Raval</strong></p></blockquote><p>Hence, we found several cheap nitrogen sources like <strong>soyabean liquor, corn steep liquor, cotton seed flour, groundnut meal, yeast extract,</strong> etc. We then curated <strong>a list of the cheapest nitrogen sources</strong> for different states of India to ensure the cheapest possible production (Refer to handbook given below). Hence the media formulation would vary from location to location depending on availability. The nitrogen content of each source must be calculated using the experiments mentioned in <strong>iGEM MIT_MAHE Product Development Experiments Handbook.</strong></p><p>Depending on the nitrogen content in the source and the stoichiometry, the amount of nitrogen source to be added must be calculated. Using the stoichiometric equation, media must be formulated</p><center>C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 1.7092O <sub>2</sub> + 0.4224 NH<sub>3</sub> → 1.76 CH<sub>1.77</sub>O<sub>0.49</sub>N<sub>0.24</sub> + 1.24 CO<sub>2</sub> + 3.076 H<sub>2</sub>O</center><center>Final metabolic stoichiometry</center><p>With <strong>respiratory coefficient</strong> of <strong>0.72676</strong> and <strong>theoretical oxygen demand</strong> of <strong>0.5945g oxygen/g glycerol.</strong></p><p>Initially, the carbon source proposed was <strong>glucose</strong> and <strong>tryptone</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>Avoid using Tryptone in large scale processes, as it is expensive. Moreover try exploring glycerol as the carbon-source instead of glucose as the uptake rate for glycerol is lower and it avoids by-products like acetic acid.</p><p><strong>Dr. Keyur Raval</strong></p></blockquote><p>Hence, <strong>glycerol</strong> was chosen - it is also cheap and readily available across all regions of India.</p><p>At first, we considered designing a bioreactor having a volume of 10000L which we changed to a more need based approach, taking in his advice. Thus, based on the amount of fish consumed per region, the amount of pills to be manufactured per region was estimated and listed (refer to handbook). Therefore, to reduce <strong>costs</strong> and <strong>wastage</strong>, <strong>three bioreactors</strong> of <strong>different sizes</strong> were designed based on <strong>low, moderate</strong> and <strong>high</strong> requirements.</p><blockquote><p>Submerged cultures are favourable for biomass production. <em>Escherichia coli</em> is a very robust cell and thus a stirred tank fermentor can be used.</p><p><strong>Dr. Vytla Ramachandra Murty</strong></p></blockquote><h3>Bioreactor Design</h3><table><caption id="table1bioreactordesignspecifications">Table 1: Bioreactor Design Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center">Volume (L)</th><th style="text-align:center">Diameter (mm)</th><th style="text-align:center">Height (mm)</th><th style="text-align:center">Number of impellers</th><th style="text-align:center" colspan="2">Position of impellers (mm)</th><th style="text-align:center">Baffle width (mm)</th><th style="text-align:center">Number of baffles</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center">100</td><td style="text-align:center">700</td><td style="text-align:center">2600</td><td style="text-align:center">2</td><td style="text-align:center">700</td><td style="text-align:center">1400</td><td style="text-align:center">70</td><td style="text-align:center">4</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">1000</td><td style="text-align:center">1550</td><td style="text-align:center">5300</td><td style="text-align:center">2</td><td style="text-align:center">1550</td><td style="text-align:center">3100</td><td style="text-align:center">155</td><td style="text-align:center">4</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">10000</td><td style="text-align:center">3300</td><td style="text-align:center">11700</td><td style="text-align:center">2</td><td style="text-align:center">3300</td><td style="text-align:center">6600</td><td style="text-align:center">33</td><td style="text-align:center">4</td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote><p>The impeller you use can have a large impact on productivity - currently SCaBa serves as the industry standard.</p><p><strong>Dr. Keyur Raval</strong></p></blockquote><div class="row"><div class="col-md"><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Implementation--tank.png" alt="Tank" style="width: 100%"><p>Figure 1: Tank</p></div></div><div class="col-md"><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Implementation--assembly.png" alt="Assembly" style="width: 106%"><p>Figure 2: Assembly</p></div></div><div class="col-md"><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Implementation--baffles.png" alt="Baffles" style="width: 79%"><p>Figure 3: Baffles</p></div></div></div><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Implementation--impeller.png" alt="Impeller" style="width: 60%"><p>Figure 4: Impeller</p></div><p><strong>Type of impeller</strong>: 6 blade curved blade impeller -&gt;

Hence, we propose <strong>cold form film</strong> as the forming film to form a blister pack. Cold form film is a multi-layered film made using <strong>PVC, aluminium foil</strong>, and <strong>polyamide like nylon</strong> each of them layered on upon the other and fixed in place by using an adhesive layer in between each of them. The PVC side is on the inside in contact with the product.</p><p>For the lidding material, a <strong>paper</strong> and <strong>an aluminium foil</strong> would be attached using an adhesive layer with the aluminium being the inner side. A layer of <strong>heat seal coating</strong> would be added to the region where the lidding material will be attached to the blisters to form a good seal.</p><div class="row"><div class="col-md"><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Safety--packaging.png" alt="Cold Form Film" style="width: 100%"><p>Figure 8: Cold Form Film</p></div></div><div class="col-md"><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Implementation--lidding.png" alt="Lidding" style="width: 100%"><p>Figure 9: Lidding</p></div></div></div><p>The aluminium used in the cold form film packaging provides a complete barrier to <strong>moisture, temperature, oxygen etc.</strong> and thus <strong>increases</strong> the effective <strong>shelf life</strong> of the product.
