We have brainstormed several experiments after thorough research and questioning, keeping in mind all the risks that could be involved but due to lack of access to laboratory facilities, we were unable to actually perform and troubleshoot them.</p><p>We have divided our experiments into three types: <strong>Chassis</strong>, <strong>Composite Bio-Brick 1</strong> and <strong>Composite Bio-Brick 2</strong> experiments. The efficiency, relevance and safety aspects of each gene and the overall project must be tested using these.</p><p>Experiments to find the threshold concentration of methylmercury required by the transformed bacteria to generate a response and a test to analyse the tolerance of the bacteria to high levels of methylmercury chloride, pH and paraquat (oxidative stress) have been designed as part of the chassis and preliminary experiments. Further experiments have been broken down to the study of the two Bio-Bricks we have designed. Characterization of the different parts of the plasmids, determination of the most efficient combination of parts, Understanding the amount of stress required to activate the parts, showing the efficiency of the system and recognition of the compatibility and working of the two plasmids are some the several aspects and considerations we have looked into. All of the experiments were designed without disregarding any safety concerns and keeping in mind good lab practices. To <strong>replicate the gut environment</strong> the experiments should be performed at a <strong>pH of 6-7</strong> and <strong>37° celsius</strong> and circuits assembled using Gibson assembly. All the measurement equipment used should be <strong>calibrated</strong> before each experiment.</p><p>Even though the methylmercury concentration that harms humans differs in different individuals, for experimental purposes we have referred to literature and chosen concentrations with <strong>known physiological effects</strong> on mice and humans <a href="#citation1">Ashner M., 2012</a>.</p><h1>Chassis</h1><p>We have proposed <em>Escherichia coli</em> Nissle 1917 as our chassis. It is a known probiotic non-pathogenic strain. We have designed experiments to show that the strain used for the probiotic to be made, <em>Escherichia coli</em> Nissle 1917 can survive under <strong>oxidative stress</strong>, <strong>varying pH</strong> and <strong>is safe</strong> <a href="#citation2">iGEM Uppsala, 2013</a> <a href="#citation3">iGEM Tuebingen, 2019</a>.</p><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Experimentation--strain.png" alt="Escherichia coli Nissle 1917" style="width: 100%"><p>Figure 1: Escherichia coli Nissle 1917</p></div><h1>Composite Bio-Brick 1</h1><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Experimentation--plasmid--1.png" alt="Composite Bio-Brick 1 - working together!" style="width: 70%"><p>Figure 2: Composite Bio-Brick 1 - working together!</p></div><h3>Preliminary Experiments</h3><p><em>Escherichia coli</em> DH5α inoculated with Composite Bio-Brick 1 should be induced with methylmercuric chloride and the fluorescence of the GFP must be measured on a spectrofluorometer (excitation-350nm, emission-500nm wavelength) after calibration. Measurement of O.D and GFP intensity should be done at intervals of 60 minutes for 4.5 hours after which minimum and maximum accumulation of mercury inside the cell must be estimated using gas chromatography <em>(Detailed protocol is given in the handbooks in the download section)</em>. In this preliminary experiment one would obtain the threshold response - which can be used as the minimum limit, and the limit of tolerance of the bacteria - to be used as the maximum limit for other experiments.</p><h3>Control Mechanism</h3><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Experimentation--bb1.jpg" alt="Control mechanism for Bio-Brick 1." style="width: 70%"><p>Figure 3: Control mechanism for Bio-Brick 1.</p></div><p>We propose to use the MerR-PmerT system as the control mechanism for the project <a href="#citation4">Brown et al., 2003</a>. Response of MerR to methylmercury should be tested using 2 control circuits which do not have the MerR gene present in them. E. coli cells inoculated with methylmercury chloride are to be grown for the required amount of time according to the results of the preliminary experiment. GFP intensities must then be checked where we expect an exponential increase in fluorescence with an increase in methylmercury concentration for the circuit with MerR present. For the control with PmerT, we expect that the transcription would be initiated but at a lower level than the test circuit. We hypothesize that the plot of fluorescence and methylmercury concentration would indicate that <strong>MerR contributes significantly in methylmercury response</strong>.</p><h3>Transport</h3><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Experimentation--mehgtransport.png" alt="Transport of Methylmercury" style="width: 40%"><p>Figure 4: Transport of Methylmercury</p></div><p>To determine the final transport design, we propose three circuits consisting of a combination of genes among MerP, MerC, MerT and MerE which should be tested. Through literature survey we have found out that three circuit designs are possible <a href="#citation5">Sone Y., et al., 2013</a>.

The effects of methylmercury concentrations to the bacterial resistance in the presence and absence of MerA and MerB with 3 circuits must be checked - The first with presence of both MerA and MerB, the second with deletion of either MerA or MerB respectively and the third with absence of both MerA and MerB. The increase in the Mer spectrum with the introduction of MerB and MerA should be checked with the expected conclusion being that the addition of the two genes confer to a <strong>better resistance to methylmercury</strong> <a href="#citation8">iGEM UFAM-UAE, 2016</a>. MTT assay must be performed to quantify the resistance provided by each gene MerA and MerB. MTT assay must be performed to quantify the resistance provided by each gene MerA and MerB. An experiment to determine the activity of MerA and MerB must be done using which the optimal CFU for the optimal enzyme concentration can be mapped.
