Our project <strong>'Breaking Bond'</strong> aims to utilize synthetic biology to provide a solution to combat this issue of global importance. As the methylmercury absorption occurs through the gut, we have proposed <strong>a novel engineered probiotic bacterium</strong>, capable of <strong>converting methylmercury to elemental mercury</strong> (a less toxic form), as an addition to the gut microbiome.</p><p>The <strong>elemental mercury</strong> thus released, is much safer as less than <strong>0.01%</strong> of it is absorbed by the intestines compared to methylmercury of which <strong>95%</strong> gets absorbed <a href="#citation9">National Research Council, 2000</a>. The elemental mercury will thus be <strong>eliminated through faeces.</strong> This will serve as a long term and efficient solution and can be made accessible to many people, both in terms of cost as well as usability.</p><p>The release of <strong>elemental mercury</strong> has the potential to disturb the gut microbiota and induce <strong>inflammations.</strong> In order to negate this side effect, we have also included a mechanism to tackle the problem.</p><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Description--josh-withers.jpg" alt="Evil Methylmercury"><p>Figure 4: Evil Methylmercury</p></div><h1>Finding Inspiration</h1><p>Our team leader, Varun Udaya Kumar, heard about the iGEM competition when he was in high school. When he joined our university, Manipal, one of India’s leading academic and research institutions, he noticed that there weren’t any biotechnology-based student projects here, so he decided to start an iGEM team here. Even though this is our first time participating in iGEM, we have received a lot of support from our professors and administration!</p><p>Our team came up with many different ideas for this year’s project, and narrowing them down to a single topic seemed almost impossible. Varun then suggested we could help tackle the problem of methylmercury poisoning. He had read about this issue in a local newspaper - as it was affecting the coastal town, also his native place - Mangalore, where seafood is highly popular. The rest of the team was almost immediately on board, given that many people in our country consume seafood and rice (which are probable sources of methylmercury poisoning). We felt that it would be highly beneficial if we could find an efficient solution to this problem.</p><h1>COVID-19 and us</h1><p>The COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact on the direction of our project. The beginning of our journey coincided with the start of the lockdowns due to the pandemic, leaving us with a complete lack of access to various facilities and resources. We were left with nothing but a highly enthusiastic team. We missed out on enjoying bonding sessions with the team, going to various schools to share the beauty of biology, frustrating yet fun-filled successes and failures during experimentation and much more. The human practices aspect was probably affected the most as all our appointments with the local fisheries got cancelled. Our team was split apart, true to our project’s name, although our bonds could not be broken. The situation, however, introduced us to a new perspective of biological research. The shift from traditional lab-based work to data-based research helped us appreciate what the proteins are, along with their effects. We hope that future iGEM teams will find this project helpful in furthering knowledge.</p></article><article id="references"><h1>References</h1><ol><li id="citation1"><p class="author">Allen, M.
